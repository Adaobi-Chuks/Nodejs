# API Structure

This document outlines the recommended directory structure for a basic Node.js API project.

## Benefits of a Structured Project:

- **Improved Maintainability:** A well-organized structure makes code easier to understand, modify, and extend for future developers.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each directory focuses on a specific aspect of the application, promoting clean code and reducing complexity.
- **Scalability:** The structure can easily accommodate growth as the project evolves.

## Directory Breakdown:

- **Configs**
This directory can store configuration files for the application, such as database connection details, environment variables, or API keys.
- **Controllers**
This directory houses the logic for handling incoming API requests. Controllers typically receive requests from the routing layer, interact with models and services, and prepare the response data.
- **Middlewares**
This directory contains middleware functions that can be used to intercept requests and responses throughout the application lifecycle. Common middleware functions include authentication, logging, error handling, and request parsing.
- **Models**
This directory contains representations of data entities used within the application. Models typically interact with the database layer to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
- **Routes**
This directory defines the API endpoints for the application. Each route maps a specific URL path and HTTP method to a corresponding controller function.
- **Services**
This directory can contain reusable functionalities that can be utilized by controllers or other parts of the application. Services encapsulate complex logic or business rules, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **Utils**
This directory can hold utility functions that provide general-purpose helper functionalities used across the application. This could include functions for data validation, string manipulation, or date formatting.
- **Tests**
This directory should contain unit and integration tests for your API code. Writing tests ensures code quality and helps catch regressions during future development.
